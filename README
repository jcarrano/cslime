## CSlime ##

This is a clone of the (once) popular game 'slime voleyball', see:
	http://www.slimeathlete.com/game.php?game=slime_volleyball_multi).
The original source (in Java) is available at 
	http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~horkana/work/slime.html
This version was done from scratch and is (hopefully) cleaner, more modular and
easily extensible/modifiable. In particular, the back-end and the graphics are
in separate modules.
The aim of this project is to develop AI algorithms and (eventually) ouperform
humans.

## Game physics ##

There are two collision models implemented by the game module 'cslime.c'. The
first (oblique_collision) is a more realistic model. The second is borrowed from
the original game (original_collision). Currently the collision between the ball
and the player uses the second model, as this makes for a nicer gameplay.

## Documentation ##

At the moment, the code is pretty much undocumented, sorry for that.
